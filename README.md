# Topic 1: Advanced loops
# Explanation of programs using loop:
# Write a program that checks whether a given number is prime or not using a loop.
This program is used to check whether a given number is a prime number or not by using a loop.
A prime number is defined as a number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving any remainder.
In this program, the user provides a number as input, and the program uses a loop to test whether the number is divisible by any other number. 
The loop starts checking from the smallest possible divisor and continues until a suitable condition is met.
If the number is found to be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, the program concludes that the number is not prime.
Otherwise, if no such divisor is found, the number is declared a prime number. This program helps students understand how loops and conditional statements work together.

# Write a program that takes a number and reverses it using a loop.
This program takes a number from the user and reverses it using a loop. 
Reversing a number means arranging its digits in the opposite order.
The program works by repeatedly extracting the last digit of the number and adding it to a new variable that stores the reversed number. 
After extracting the digit, the original number is reduced by removing its last digit. 
This process continues inside a loop until the number becomes zero.
At the end of the loop, the reversed number is displayed as output.
This program helps students learn how to manipulate numbers using loops and understand the use of mathematical operations inside a loop.

# Write a program to count how many digits are in a number using a loop. 
This program counts the total number of digits present in a given number using a loop.
The user enters a number, and the program repeatedly divides the number by 10 inside a loop.
Each time the number is divided by 10, one digit is removed, and a counter is increased by one.
The loop continues until the number becomes zero. 
Once the loop ends, the counter holds the total number of digits in the number. 
This program is useful for understanding how loops can be used to repeatedly process a number until a certain condition is reached.

# Write a program to print the first N Fibonacci numbers using a loop.
This program prints the first N numbers of the Fibonacci series using a loop.
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and every following number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
The program starts by initializing the first two numbers of the series and then uses a loop to calculate the next numbers.
The loop runs until the required number of terms is printed.
This program helps students understand how values change step by step inside a loop and how previous results are used to calculate new values.

# Use nested loops to print the following pattern.  
This program uses nested loops to print a square pattern made of stars.
Nested loops mean one loop is placed inside another loop.
In this program, the outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop controls the number of stars printed in each row. 
For every iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop prints the same number of stars.
This results in a square-shaped pattern. 
This program helps students understand how nested loops work together and how patterns can be created using repetition.

#  Use nested loops to print the following pattern. 
This program uses nested loops to print a right-angled triangle pattern using stars.
The outer loop controls the number of rows, and the inner loop prints stars according to the current row number.
In the first row, one star is printed, in the second row two stars are printed, and this process continues until the required number of rows is completed.
This program helps students clearly understand the concept of nested loops and how the output changes with each iteration of the loop.
